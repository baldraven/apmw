# APMW

You're a bunch of bloodthirsty (and hyperactive) werewolves, that have to eat their preys quickly in order to stay alive. Check the mini-map in order to locate the preys and keep track of the werewolves position, so you can make a decision on which prey's time has come to an end.

## Release

Prototype is available online on Itch.io at https://baldraven.itch.io/apmw
It's also possible to play directly the game natively on your machine, by downloading [LÖVE](https://love2d.org/) and running the game's source code with it.

## How to play

The game is about being quick with his fingers, as the deplacement speed and the damage dealt is reliant on the number of key pressed. An action per minute counter is being shown on the top right corner.\
The health bars are currently not restrictive : they can go below or above the normal range, so you can chip away your enemies stress-free.

Controls :
- w, a, s ,d : change direction
- q / e : move left/right foot forward (alterning)
- 1 / 3 : left/right claw hit (alterning)
- 2 : special move
- z / x / c : select werewolf 1/2/3

Werewolves :
- The first one has balanced stats. His special attack finish off the prey if its health is low enough.
- The second one has great mobility thanks to his teleportation skill, as well as a lot of power on his attacks. However, his stamina gets drained quickly and has to drink a lot of blood.
- The last one, on the opposite, can stay longer without eating a prey, but has very low damage. He relies and making his opponents bleed over time with his special attack.

## About

APMW is a prototype game made with the Lua framework LÖVE. I was working on it in 2019, during high school. All my programming knowledge was self-taught back then.

At some point, I want to come back and try to make something out of it. I think the gameplay concept, as is, is risky and not user-friendly. But it could work with good execution and ajustments.
